						The Jellyfish Light Show is the name of the CSM Alive performance I produced and created with
						Inigo Townsend. The original stimulus for this project was came from the sight of my seeing
						hundreds of various breeds of jellyfish washed up dead on the seashore first thing in the
						morning when I was back home in West Wales over the first coronavirus lockdown in June
						2020. This triggered feelings of being washed up myself, something I wanted to capture in this
						final piece. At the same time, I wanted to create something fun to evoke and my pre-pandemic
						life. Inigo and I were imagining the atmosphere of the piece and how we could best describe
						what happened to these jellyfish in the night leading up to them washing up dead on the shore.

						Inigo and I visited the Electronica exhibition at the Design Museum in November 2020 and this reminded us how much we'd been missing electronic music and lifestyle. This led us onto the path of electronic music and nightlife, something we had both been missing.

						The Jellyfish Light Show is a dance movement piece choreographed in collaboration with the
						three performers: Stella, Charles, and Isobel. This 13-minute performance was performed in the
						Studio Theatre at Central Saint Martins on May 19th, 2021.
						<br> <br>
						In creating this performance, Inigo and I divided the design work between the two of us: I drew the costumes and Inigo drew the set. We agreed what we wanted to achieve.
						<br> <br>
						Together, we knew that for that for the set we wanted to use live feed cameras with
						projections onto screens as we had done Design for Dance performance the previous year, and
						for our collective project: Just Another Soup Can.

						In the early days of designing the Jellyfish Light Show, Inigo and I worked out a timeline of the
						piece including key moment that we wanted to create, defining mood change or disorientation.
						In this timeline we included the lighting design that we imagined going with each mood change.
						This timeline breakdown was used to show to the sound composer, Significant Other, and the
						dancers when we presented the project to them.

						<p style="font-size: 18px;"> I use my sketchbook in the design process to try out
						different shapes on the body. This is important to
						develop on my understanding what will work on stage
						during the performance. Through research into the
						shapes and textures of sea creatures, I found
						secondary references of Dutch fashion designer Iris
						Van Herpen haute couture collection. From using
						these references in my sketchbook, I can imagine
						different aspects of the costume to figure out if they
						will work for a movement piece. For example, at this
						point early in the design process I wanted to use
						knee high socks with gathers to represent the jellyfish
						tentacles going down the body. I didn’t use knee
						socks, I ended up using this concept to go all over
						the body on the blue costume for ‘Glacial’. </p>
						<br> <br>
						The Pepper’s Ghost technique was introduced to us by the theatre company Imitating the Dog
						and in lessons taught by Pete Brooks. Inigo and I were inspired by the concept for (RE)
						presenting reality to the audience in front of them by augmenting the image to create another
						dimension to the atmosphere of the room. The below image is from an experimental day in the studio theatre on March 24th 2021.

						We decided to use three performers to give the impression of a cluster of jellyfish, similar to
						the ones I had seen on the sands. In terms of costumes, from a previous dance project I knew
						that the stretchiness of lycra leotards and leggings would be ideal to allow the dancers
						maximum movement. To achieve a strong tactile effect, I chose velvet, organza and taffeta to
						sculpt the shapes of ocean creatures, including the frill effect of jellyfish tentacles.

						Covid restrictions proved especially challenging for several reasons during the creation of the
						production. Having to source fabrics for the costumes online, for example, meant I was unable
						to see and feel them. Social distancing also made pattern cutting more difficult without the
						costume technicians help to make the adjustments onto paper patterns to fit the dancers, most
						importantly not being able to work closely with the dancers during the costume making. We
						also knew that because of restrictions, the possibility of the final performance having to be in
						an outdoor space would have a huge impact on lighting and the final visual effect. Many final
						decisions, therefore, had to be made in a short space of time.
						The way that we choreographed the piece meant that we could collaborate with the
						performers to make a 10-minute show. Inigo and I focused on two key moments in the music to
						achieve intensity in the movement. This included a build up of slow bobbing movements in
						synchronicity that led to each of the performer disconnected in an overwhelming shaking
						movement.

						<p style="font-size: 18px;"> Through the experimentation process I came up with three options for how I could make
						the puff’s for the arms and legs of the character Swelter. All three samples have different
						qualities and out if these three, the top and bottom ones shown in the image were the
						best. Still, they were not exactly what I wanted because the top sample was too curly to
						sew each individual strip of fabric with shirring elastic. Whereas the bottom sample was
						better structured and more durable, it lost all of its texture. Therefore I decided to
						continue sampling until I made a puff that would be durable and textured.</p>
						<br>
						<img src="C.3.png" width="700" height="500">
						<p style="font-size: 18px;">After spending much time experimenting with various colours of organza, using several techniques. I finally chose to create the 16 puffs for the costume of swelter using the technique called ‘knife pleats’. During this time I also finished all of the alterations for the unitard,
						meaning I could attach the puffs directly onto the arms and legs.
						<br>
						<img src="C.4.jpeg" width="500" height="500">
						<p style="font-size: 18px;"> I brought the work in progress to rehearsal so that I could see how the fabrics looked under the
						lights in the Studio Theatre. This image shows Charles warming up with the part finished costume
						on.

						that we were able to collaborate on the choreography to tell the
						story of the jellyfish. </p>
