						I started Unit 9 in August of 2020, after a long national lockdown struggling to make
						work in isolation. I contacted a student producer at the National Film and Television School
						(NFTS) to design the costumes for their short film When Another Does the Same. I was
						interested in cultivating my skillset for my main focus, which had been growing towards
						costume for performance. Despite having no prior experience working on a film set I
						reasoned that experience in film and TV would be forward thinking considering the way
						Covid-19 would alter the entertainment industry. In October 2020 following that first film, I
						designed costumes in collaboration with Inigo Townsend for a short film at NFTS called
						Square Peg, Round Hole. There is a much wider scope withing Film to connect to a global
						audience remotely, compared to live performances which requires a crowd of people.
						Despite the issues around social distancing, the distinct energy generated from a live
						performance is unparallel in film. I kept hope that I would be able to produce a performance
						with a live audience in my final year. Having considered this, it seems fair to say a main
						challenge has been working around the Coronavirus pandemic. My whole degree thus far
						had focused on collaboration and audience experience. With the audience suddenly
						removed, and collaboration and audience participation proving to be impossible, I realized
						the value of being with people. I no longer take for granted the opportunity to sit in a room
						with another artist to make work for others to see in life.
						<br> <br> <br> <br>
						Despite the circumstances in a small group, Jida Akil, Inigo Townsend and I managed
						to make our final performance of the Collective, a socially distanced performance without
						an audience. This project told the story of the 1968 shooting of artist Andy Warhol from the
						point of view of his attacker – the radical feminist Valarie Solanas. The Collective
						encouraged me to develop on my technical software skills using Isadora to render images
						into live performance form. This resulted in me directing the Collective performance, which
						was a new experience and honestly out of my comfort zone. Unexpectedly I gained
						invaluable leadership skills which have consistently served me in later projects, and
						undoubtably into the future as I build my own production company. After Collective, Inigo
						and I began to develop our set costume designs for CSM Alive. We began to fully explore the
						performance design in a studio equipment with projectors, lights and tv monitors whilst
						using various fabrics to test out concepts. Subsequently, there began another national
						lockdown in December that lasted all the way until April 2021, this massively affected our
						work, and everything was put on hold. During this lockdown I was called by the Production
						Designer from one of the previous films I worked on to design the costumes for another
						NFTS film, The Keeper, a horror that is part of the annual festival Gorefest. This was an
						exciting project for me to take part in because of my long-time enthusiasm for the horror
						genre, this project was a turning point as I was able to make the costumes as well as source
						them. Filming for The Keeper took place in February, and I was lucky enough simultaneously
						receive a place on a two-week intensive workshop at the pleasance theatre. The workshop
						was led by Lecoq trained Anna Marshall and Alice Devlin from Bric a Brac theatre company.
						A unique collective of women, focused on feminist theatre shows and live experiences. The
						Keeper and The Pleasance workshop were both wonderful ways to keep myself active during
						the lockdown that held me back from making my own large-scale performances in Central
						Saint Martins. I was able to learn from others and create exciting performances while
						developing my designs for CSM Alive. Finally, in April when restrictions were easing, Inigo
						and I were hired to design the press window display of Janet Jacksons stage costumes for
						the auction company Julien’s Auctions at the Hard Rock Café. Through this, we gained skills
						on exhibition curation and design presentation.
						<br> <br> <br> <br>
						My underlying drive has always to make work for others to enjoy and participate in
						through sensory experience. I am delighted to have been able to put on the live
						performance of my CSM Alive collaboration with Inigo ‘The Jellyfish Light Show’ on May
						19th, 2021. Unit 9 has triggered the formation of a Creative Direction company with Inigo,
						producing work that is both tailored to client briefs and original ideas. I am now working on
						the wardrobe department for Trade, an MA Directing Theatre show with a small audience in
						the studio theatre at Central Saint Martins from June 21st. I want to use design to ask
						different questions of the world, costume design gives me a voice to tell stories and give
						detail to an audience visually. The last year has allowed me to become more visible in the
						world of design, I take every project as it comes and value the importance of liveness. For
						our next project, Inigo and I have been hired as the creative directors of an immersive
						performance bar in Dalston, London. We envision creating an environment based on Charlie
						and the Chocolate Factory (1971) directed by Mel Stuart with the main character of the
						performance being a figure called Billy Bonkers. I have discovered that working
						simultaneously on costume and set is as important in creating a narrative as the content of a
						performance. Through utilizing a visual language, you enrich the audience experience
						adding a unique dimension that connects directly to experience and emotion.
