					<div class="contentText contentPadding">
						The Collective project led by tutor Pete Brooks on the PDP course at Central Saint
						Martins was my second experience of the project. I learned so much on the project in 2019
						that I was delighted to take part again in 2020. The Collective is a great project for students
						of Performance Design because it teaches the importance of collaboration in
						the theatre industry. Every student that takes part in this project has different strengths
						which are utilised to create a final performance.

						For the collective in a time of COVID-19 was a class, split into small groups that would
						bubble for the five week project. I worked with fellow students Jida Akil and Inigo
						Townsend.
						We spent some time deliberating what we would make our 10-minute semi-animated
						graphic novel film about. We decided to tell the story of the shooting of Andy Warhol in
						1968, from the point of view his radical-feminist attacker, Valarie Solanas.
						In the first mood board you can see we were looking at concepts having to do with the
						themes of egotism, feminism and dreams. Here we reference images of Andy Warhol and
						his entourage, woman’s protests in the 60’s in America, The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (Robert
						Wiene), Rocky Horror Picture Show (Jim Sharman) and war politics propaganda on
						women.

						The Collective 2020 project was completely new and different however because of its
						adaption to the Coronavirus pandemic. All the same, using the software Isadora, we
						were able to produce a ten-minute performance completely under socially distancing
						rules. Due to Covid-19 restrictions we had to work in smaller groups; I teamed up with Jida
						Akil and Inigo Townsend. The brief for this project was to research the visual style of graphic
						novels and narrative structure of short stories, and to animate the visual spaces for our final
						performance. In our small group we came up with the idea to make our performance about
						the shooting of Andy Warhol from the point of view of his Feminist attacker Valerie Solanas.
					<br> <br>

						Research into graphic novels and short stories led us to gain inspiration from the comic book
						Scott Pilgrim, and the films Taxi Driver, Vertigo, Terminator and The Shining. We were
						inspired by these films because of their colour pallete and the high level of action and detail
						and especially interested in learning from their shot types, such as low angles to establish
						power and extreme close-up to reveal emotion.

						As we were unable to use props and build sets because the props and tools had to be
						quarantined, we decided to ‘go wild’ and incorporate objects in our animations that we
						would not normally have access to, such as large buildings and weapons. We painted comic
						book strips by hand of street scenes and hallways and scanned them into the computer.
					<br> <br>
						
						The Costume Design:
						The 1960s in America was a major turning point for women, when a second wave of
						feminism really came into action. It was a time when they were finally being able to join the
						work force, legally allowed to divorce without permission of their partner, and the
						contraceptive pill was made widely available. Thinking about how fashion and culture are so
						deeply intertwined, we researched the androgenous fashion movement of the 60’s and
						specifically the Mods look with its subversive beauty standards, mask-like make-up and
						asymmetric bob. We decided to use elements of this look for Valerie, to dress the character
						in trousers as a symbol independence and maturity.

						Despite the constraints of working during the pandemic, I learnt a huge amount. Learning to
						use the Isadora software especially pushed me and there was a huge amount of painting
						involved and taking on several roles at once. Unlike the 2019 Collective where a huge
						amount of co-operation was needed across a bigger group, the 2020 project pushed me out
						of my comfort zones and meant that I had to direct as well as design. Another great
						outcome was that without a live audience, we could do as many takes as we wanted and, in
						the end, reach a greater online audience than we might have done with a live performance.
